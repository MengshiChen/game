      <h2>Concept</h2>
       <h4>Game Title:</h4> <p> Super Stressed Student World </p>
           <h4>Programmer name:</h4> <p> Krystal Ruiz </p>
           <h4>Artist name:</h4> <p>Mengshi Chen</p>
           <h4>Description: </h4><p>The life of a university student can be stressful at times and work can pile up in an instant if one isn’t consistent and/or starts slacking off even for a moment. Super Stressed Student World represents this exact scenario.
           In this game, the player is immediately thrusted into a university college campus. As the player is forced to navigate the scene by jumping over obstacles and on top of objects, the goal is to avoid getting hit by teachers and homework sprites and to collect as many floating coffee mugs(worth 2.5 energy points) and snacks(worth 1 energy point) as possible before time runs out or before the student runs out of stamina and can no longer run or jump very high and inevitably gets overtaken by the screen or falls to the ground from exhaustion, both circumstances effectively ending the game.</p>
           <h4>Game Objects:</h4> <p>The player will be awarded energy/stamina points every time they jump towards a floating coffee mug(worth 2.5 energy points) and floating snacks(worth 1 energy point) that allows the character to jump and run to the highest potential. Homework sprites are sometimes thrown toward the student which can also pile up and weigh/ slow the character down for a few seconds if too many hit the student at once.</p>
           <h4>Sounds:</h4><p>There are a mixture of fantasy sound effects along with background music.</p>
           <h4>Controls:</h4> <p>The arrow keys are used in place of the arrow keys to move the character around. The ‘w’ key is used to jump.</p>
           <h4>Game flow:</h4> <p>The player will first be presented with the main menu that gives the option to adjust settings, to quit the game, to play a quick tutorial or to start the game. The main menu will also present the option to start a new game file or to discard the current game file allowing up to a total of three to be displayed/exist at one time. If the player presses ‘start the game,’ the player will immediately start the game as the screen automatically scrolls forward toward the right, getting slightly faster every 20 seconds. While avoiding being overtaken by the scrolling screen, the student has to make it to class before the timer runs out or before their stamina does. Once certain checkpoints have been reached, the ‘s’ key can be used to save the game while pressing the ‘Esc’ key will exit the game. When the game ends, your high score will be shown and you’ll be put back in front of the main menu.</p>
           <h4> Levels:</h4> <p>The tutorial option will go through general gameplay mechanics and start off by placing the player in a slowed down, step-by-step version of the first level. This walkthrough will contain a brief explanation of the general game controls and the point system when jumping into coffee mugs and snacks and when coming into contact with obstacles.
           There is only 1 level in which every twenty seconds, the scrolling screen will move a little bit faster.</p>
